when you add en new library make sure you run npm install again to make sure you have all dependancies installed.
watch out though, when run this, it could cause another error. It probably has something to do with the .vite file in your project.
just delete this file and it should work again. if you are not sure what to do, just paste the error into chatGPT, it usaly knows whats causing it.
